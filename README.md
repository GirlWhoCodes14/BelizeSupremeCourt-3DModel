### About the Supreme Court of Belize

The Supreme Court is in my home of Belize City, Belize. It is a historical building and landmark. According to travelbelize.org, “The New Orleans style building is known for its filigreed iron stairs, its balcony rails and its four-sided clock.” 

## Highlights and Lowlights of the Process
### Highlights (What I Liked)
I like that I learnt and utilized skills that can be used to further my career in Computer Science. I researched architecture and building designs. Since I enjoy learning, that was an interesting and satisfying experience. I, also, got the dimensions and photos of parts of the building that cannot be found on the web from an employee that works in the building.  Lastly, I felt gratification as I slowly saw my creation take shape.

### Lowlights (What I Didn't Like)
What I don’t like is that the project was time-consuming. I wanted a detailed and realistic model, which required a lot of trial and error.  I remade many parts of the building to ensure it was up to my high standards. Although the model is realistic and true to the fundamental style of the building, it is a clean remake of an old building, so it does not show the wear and tear of years of use and prosperity.
